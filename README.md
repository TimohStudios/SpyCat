# SpyCat
A WebRTC application to remotely spy on @antonk52's cats  

## The idea
SSH into a laptop, start the program, open a link that is shown in the console, see what the cats are up to. If they're not being nice, tell them.

## Suggestions
I found [this library named PeerJS](http://peerjs.com) which I think would be nice to use. It seems pretty easy and good.  
We were planning to boot this up through SSH. We could write a bash script, but I think going with Gulp would also be cool as we could use it in development and it would immediately be cross-platform.
